    <h1 class="blinking">ENTER THE VOID</h1>
    <h2 id="white"> 2009</h2>
    <p class="beautiful-element">Enter the Void is about life after death. Specifically, it's about the life after death that
        troubles all of us atheists and rationalists most of all: the life after death that we all
        believe in – other people's lives in this busy and unhappy world carrying on heedlessly after
        we are dead.</p>

        Enter the Void is, in its way, just as provocative,
        just as extreme, just as mad, just as much of an
        outrageous ordeal: it arrives here slightly
        re-edited from the version first shown at Cannes.
        But despite its querulous melodrama and crazed
        Freudian pedantries, it has a human purpose the
        previous film lacked, and its sheer deranged
        brilliance is magnificent. This is a grandiose
        hallucinatory journey into, and out of, hell:
        drugged, neon-lit and with a fully realised
        nightmare-porn aesthetic that has to be seen to
        be believed.

        Love him or loathe him – and I've
        done both in my time – Gaspar Noé is one of the
        very few directors who is actually trying to do
        something new with the medium, battling at the
        boundaries of the possible. It has obvious debts,
        but Enter the Void is utterly original film-making,
        and Noé is a virtuoso of camera movement.

        We get the classic Noé tropes: throbbing ambient
        soundscape, murky lighting design bursting into
        unwatchable vortices of dazzling, flickering
        light, explicit sex and violence, colossal
        sans-serif lettering for the title- and end-credits.
        This film, however, has a new motif: what we see is
        purely the point of view of its leading figure; we
        watch everything through his eyes.

        He is a small-time drug-dealer called Oscar
        (Nathaniel Brown). Irréversible had a horrific
        club called the Rectum; this one has a bar in
        Tokyo called the Void, where Oscar is shot by
        cops. His spirit hovers over the city, an unquiet
        ghost unable or unwilling to leave, watching
        over his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta), a
        pole-dancer now utterly alone in the world.
